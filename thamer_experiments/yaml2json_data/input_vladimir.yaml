  titleAdded: Passageway
  text: |
    There shall be an easily noticeable passageway
    with a width of at least 1,200 millimetres
    and a smooth, hard and non-slippery surface
    that leads to the building
    from the boundary of the plot or building site
    and from the space and area that serve the use of the building.
    The gradient of the passageway located in an outdoor space may not exceed five per cent.
    If there are steps on the passageway, there shall also be
    a ramp
    or a permanently installed device intended for lifting persons
    that is suitable for a user of a wheelchair and walking frame with wheels.
    The provisions of this subsection do not apply to
    a detached house, semi-detached house or townhouse
    if providing an accessible passageway would be impossible
    considering the site and elevation differences.
